# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Rails app for saving user documents

**Thoughts:** I can't really say this is new to me, I have done apps like this a lot, but it felt good going back to basics and building a nice and short app to make me flex my fingers and getting from here to there easily.

### Day 2: April 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the introduction for the Google machine learning course

**Thoughts:** I started doing the Pandas introduction and I keep thinking this type of courses where practical knowledge interlaces with new concepts is really cool, I haven't been so excited about learning something new in a lot of time.

I had to spend some time getting up to speed, and setting up an updated Python version, but it was really cool.
