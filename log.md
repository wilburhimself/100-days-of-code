# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Rails app for saving user documents

**Thoughts:** I can't really say this is new to me, I have done apps like this a lot, but it felt good going back to basics and building a nice and short app to make me flex my fingers and getting from here to there easily.
